## Why Blocks?

Training Blocks are more then training plans. They Bundle goals, progression markers, and various tools you to hit your goal over a specific time period for a specfic sport.

Stop, start and pause your training blocks when you neeed too. Chain your blocks together and create advanced forecasts.

Should your pause or stop your current block, all of your subsequent blocks will be reprogramed.
