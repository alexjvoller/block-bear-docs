## Review your Past

The Trackable Projections Graph is an interactive display of the history of a measured trackable.

For all of your blocks, if you applied a goal to that measured trackable we also overlay the goal and the block data on the graph so you can see how far you've come.

## Plan your Future

Goals for future blocks will also be presented, so you can create advanced forecasts and have known values for when you want to be in two, three blocks time.

If blocks are chained together, the forecast values will be recalulated if any schedule options in the linked blocks change.
