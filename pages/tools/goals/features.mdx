## Dashboard

Set goals and track them through your block goal dashboard.

TODO: Goal Dashboard

## Simple and Smart

Goals are Complex; we've simplified it. Apply the following options to set the right goal for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Start Value">
    Either set manual start value, use latest recorded value, or forecast value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose incremental progression, or set fixed number for the end of the block ">
    Set a hard end-goal or a incremental target for a defined period. Period
    options are weekly, monthly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle to use % values">
    You can use either a fixed value like: run 5km per week. Or a percentage
    value like: run +10% per week.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use Latest Recorded Value

TODO: add image of toggle field.
Toggle the "set intial to latest" checkbox, and we'll use your latest data for the selected trackable.

This ensures that blocks can build from each other, and no need to re-baseline at the end of each training program.

### Use Forecast Values

If chaining blocks together, and the schedule status of the block your drafting is set to "Scheduled After", an additonal option to use the forecast end-value of the previous option will appear.

This feature enables you to create advanced forecasts on your trackables.

If you schedule changes, or you shuffle blocks, don't worry, we'll recalculate your forecasts when this happens.

## Compliance

### Programmable Tolerances because life-happens

If you, or your coach, want to keep you accountable, goals can be setup with a tolerance field in terms of a number or percentage.
We'll track the number of data points that are recorded in and out of the target and it's tolerance; and report the total score.

### In-flight Modifications

Goals can be modified mid-block by you or your coach, and can be set to automatically adjust based on other block measured statistics.

We'll track these changes through a "Phase".
