## Condition Logic

Advanced training blocks can factor complex statistics and variables when deciding an athletes goal.

We support this functionality in-platform by setting conditions which will modify goal-targets

### If this, then ...

A condition will change a goal target based if a statistics value meets a threshold in your training block.

## Creating a condition

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Goal">Click the goal from the dashboard</Step>
  <Step title="Select Add Condition"></Step>
  <Step title="Select Statistic">
    We will provide you a list of the in-block statistics being track. If the
    statistic is not yet created, then see [creating a
    statistic](../statistics/add).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Threshold Operator">
    Either: Less Than, Equal To, or Greater Than{" "}
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Activation Value">
    The value for us to flag the acceptence prompt to modify the goal
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

Everytime you lodge a data point for a measured trackable we recaulate both the statistics and the goals in the training block.

If the re-calculated statistic is above/below/equal to the threshold value, then Block Bear will display an approval modal to update the goal with a new phase.
