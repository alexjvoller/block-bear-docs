## support for all variants

Goals come in all shapes and sizes. Our goal forms are a blank canvas with support for all variants under the hood. Here are the types we support:

<ParamField path="change goals">
  you may want to specify that your target is the change as oppose to total
  value. For example "lose 20kg" represents a change of -20kg whilst I want to
  be 70kg is a total finishing point.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="incremental goals">
  you eat an elephant one bite at a time, which is why goals are often expressed
  as a rate of change as opposed to a fixed value at the end of the block. You
  can vary the increment toggling between day, week, month and year.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="relative goals">
  losing one lb of bodyweight a week means two different things if you weigh
  150lbs vs 350lbs, which is why goals are often expressed as a percentage.
  Using percentage goals allows for the value to be expressed as percentage, for
  example lose 0.5% per week.
</ParamField>

<Tip>
  Combinations of change, incremental and relative settings support all
  different goal variants your coach, or the internet, may tell you. For example
  the statement "lose 0.5% bodyweight per week" is a change goal, with a weekly
  increment, and uses percentages

## dynamic goals

No need to scrap your plan if you go off-target with dynamic goals. Goals can be adjusted from the start of the block, or you can keep your previous trendline and start a new phase. This will create a waypoint on your goal's trendline so you can see your past and amended trendlines.

When setting a new phase, "set target to actual" sets the start point of your new goal phase to your actual trendline. "set target to target" sets the target your previous goals target trendline.

<Tip>
  {" "}
  A common example for dynamic goal adjustments to support unexpected initial actual
  trendlines. For example if you set out on a bodyweight cut and your initial caloric
  planning was too high, after a few weeks the difference between your actual and
  goal trendlines might be too great to be of any actual value.

Adding a new phase with the "reset initial to actual" option will reset the goal back onto your actual data; whilst preserving the previous data so you can review
in future.
