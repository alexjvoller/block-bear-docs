<Tip>
  actual (purple) vs target (orange) trendline analysis often is far more
  important then the induvidual values. In the above I got sick in Jul which
  deleted over 3kgs, howevever you can see the trendline of sections pre and
  post roughly match the target trend. Another option would have been to set a
  new goal phase and reset the goal initial to my post-sickness starting weight.

## data and trends

One-off blow outs, outliers, and routine fluctuations are common in most data-sets; especially for health and fitness analytics. Scientists combat this by analyzing trendlines to view overall trends of the data set, which is why we've baked this functionality into all of our cards.

The data we support are below:

<ParamField path="actual">
  these are the values of your actual completed cards. They are seen as dots on
  the chart.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="actual linear">
  a linear plot calculated from your actual data points
  <Tip>
  Use the actual linear trendline as the source of truth for those data sets
  which fluctuate widely pending a number of variables you can or can't control.
  Bodyweight tracking is notorious for this, with number of cards, salt and
  water intake, time of day and bowel movements causing your individual data points to
  vary widely. Whilst when viewed in isolation this may appear as chaos, the
  actual linear trendline will show your real trend.
</Tip>

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="target">
  the trendline of your goal as it changes from your set starting point to the
  finishing point throughout the block
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="min and max guard-rails">
  when you set a goal you can select "use tolerance" to set guard rails above
  and below your target trendlines. This determines your "compliance" value which
  is the percentage of actual data points inside the guardrails vs outside.
  
  <Tip> Use this value to report accountability to your coach, or to drive changes within
  your block programming. You can use this to throttle up your own internal accountability for peak-weeks or to get you out of a slump </Tip>
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="forecast">
  Based on your actual trendline we'll calculate your forecast target at the end
  of the block. We actively recalculate both your actual linear trendline and
  your forecast after every card completion.
  <Tip>
    {" "}
    It is extremely common to see people being too aggressive with their goals. The
    forecast value is key to give you that peace of mind that you're on track. If you
    know your waist needs to be 32" to fit into your wedding suit pants in 10 weeks
    time, then only make nutritional or training adjustments if the forecast is widely
    off{" "}
