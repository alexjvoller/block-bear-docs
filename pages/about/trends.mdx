## data and trends

One-off blow outs, outliers, and routine fluctations are common in most data-sets; especially for health and fitness analytics. Scientists combat this by analysing trendline to view overall trend of the data set, which is why we've baked this functionality into all of our cards.

The data we support are below:

<ParamField path="actual">
  these are the values of your actual completed cards. They are seen as dots on
  the chart.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="actual linear">
  a linear plot calculated from your actaul data points
  <Tip>
  Use the actual linear trendline as the source of truth for those data sets
  which fluate widely pending a number of variables you can or can't control.
  Bodyweight tracking is natorious for this, with number of cards, salt and
  water intake, time of day and bowel causing your induvidual data points to
  vary widly. Whilst when viewed in isolation this may appear as choas, the
  actual linear trendline will show your real trend.
</Tip>

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="target">
  the trendline of your goal as it changes from your set starting point to the
  finishing point throughout the block
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="min and max guard-rails">
  when you set a goal your can select "use tolerance" to set guard rails above
  and below your target trendlines. This determine your "compliance" value which
  is the percentage of actaul data points inside the guardrails vs outside.
  
  <Tip> Use this value to report accountability to your coach, or to drive changes within
  your block programming. You can use this to throttle up your own internal accountability for peak-weeks or to get you out of a slump </Tip>
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="forecast">
  Based on your actual trendline we’ll calculte your forecast target at the end
  of the block. We actively recalculate both your actual linear trendline and
  your forecast after every card completion.
  <Tip>
    {" "}
    It is extremely common to see people being too aggresive with their goals. The
    forecast value is key to give you that peace of mind that your on track. If you
    know your waist needs to be 32" to fit into your wedding suit pants in 10 weeks
    time, then only make nutritional or training adjustments if the forecast is widly
    off{" "}
