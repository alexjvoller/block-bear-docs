## flexibility

Easily add or remove cards from your day by using the journal card search bar. This search bar accesses all the cards in the block bear universe; allowing for a simple two-step flow to add the thing you're doing to your day. If you suddenly decide to complete an interval session or if you want to upload the bodyfat results of a DEXA scan; the searchbar has you covered

If the card you're looking for isn't there; access your library to add your own custom activity sessions.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Add a card from catalogue"
    icon="text"
    href="/pages/current-block/journal#add-a-card-from-catalogue"
  >
    search for the card you need from the block bear universe
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Add a session card from library"
    icon="text"
    href="/pages/current-block/journal#add-a-session-card-from-library"
  >
    access your library to add your custom sessions
  </Card>
</Columns>

## pin to pinboard

All cards can be pinned to your block's pinboard allowing you to access the full gamut of insights and tools

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Pin an activity card"
    icon="text"
    href="/pages/current-block/journal#pin-an-activity-card"
  >
    Pin an activity card
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Pin a measured card"
    icon="text"
    href="/pages/current-block/journal#pin-a-measured-card"
  >
    access your library to add your custom sessions
  </Card>
</Columns>

     <Tip>You create different pins on a single activity if you lock a secondary field at fixed value. For example Bench Press at 1 Rep and Bench Press at 5 Reps can be two separate pins with separate goals!</Tip>
