# a journal which can finally meets your scheudle and training ambitions

Current journalling systems are either limited in scope (the majority of sport-specfic apps like Strava/Runna), are coach depenedent locking you into their services (coaching apps like MyStrengthBook), or don't have the logic and insights you need (your fallback trusty notebook or excel).

Block Bear's approach allows you to select the things you want to track from an expansive catalogue of measured cards, activity cards, and activity session cards giving you unmatched flexibilty to support for all your ambitions.

Select the cards you care about, build goals and journalling sessions around them, or search the community for science-based presets.

  ***Your data. Your goals. Your rhythm.*** Build, track, and refine every part
  of your training with modular cards and adaptive blocks that fit your schedule
  — not the other way around.

All cards support trends and goals allowing you to see progression throughout your training. We couple insights with tools like 'in-flight goal adjustments' so you never have to abandon your plans. Rather; make the nutritional or training adjustments you need to stay on track.

Lastly we bundle your journalling into distinct training blocks to allow for natural time-based objectives and periodisation. You can start, stop, pause, restart and schedule blocks allowing for your training to finally match your busy schedule.

Connect your journalling into best of the community to find block presets or coached blocks, allowing you to pivot and progress your goals no matter your progression or sport.

# journal the things your care about. a simple approach for the entire fitness industry

On the outside the fitness industry is a complex and choatic place; but it's core is the requirement to identify a few things to monitor and a few goals to progress.

What these things are, and the direction you want to trend them too is really upto you. Karen might just want to get 6000 steps a day, whereas Bob wants to track his sleep, whilst David Goggins wants to run the 240 miler MOAB whilst maintainng muscle mass.

We offer a four step approach for how we should attack this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="select">
    select the things which should be monitored.
    <Note>
      For example the majority of fitness muscle-building programs track: 1 rep
      max bench, 1 rep max deadlight, protein, sleep, daily steps to name a
      few.{" "}
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="goals">
    one or two things that you selected will have a goal, else why are we
    interested in journalling?
    <Note>
      For example: Steps - maintain 5K minimum, bodyweight - increase by 0.5%
      per week, 1 rep bench - hit 100kg HOORAH 2 plate club!{" "}
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="start and monitor">
    monitor the trends to see if you're on track. Adjust other markers as
    required, don't freak out about outliers, check up on some calculations to
    see if you're doing it right.
    <Note>
      For example: if you set your weekly run distance too high to the point of
      endless shin-splints, adjust this down or decrease other activties to
      decrease total time on toes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="review and progress">
    finish the goal, and plan your next training period. For your next block you
    may want to keep the trendlines going up, fall back to maintenance if your
    next few weeks are busy at work, or do a tactical deload. Review what worked
    and what didn't, search the marketplace for goal and block presets, or even
    blocks made by the community, to find what may work next time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The above flow is the core of our journalling methodology, and the simplest method starting, finishing and progressing your goals.

# Cards

### Measured Cards

Measured cards are things that are measured. Bodyweight, daily step count, max-speed on a wave, total elevation or all examples of measured-cards

### Activity Cards

Activity cards are for activities. Bench press, run, surf, intervals, lateral raise, toe touches are all examples of activities

### Activity Session Cards

Activity Sessions are collecitons of activites. For example an interval sessions is multiple intervals, and a chest workout is multiple sets of fly's, bench, incline.

## Card Features

- **Pin to pinboard**. view trends, create goals or add cards throughout the journal through the smart-populate feature.

  <Note>
    For example: if you set an incremental increase for your week run distance
    then the value will be calculated in the target field each week. A common
    use-case for manual targets is to manual values for fields like rpe and rep
    count.{" "}
  </Note>

- **Smart or Manual Target Values**. Smart targets are the value of goal trendline for that session. These are only available if goal is set on it in the pinboard. Alternatively a target can be set in manually.

  <Note>
    For example: steps and sleep data are wearable compatible by default. Check
    these cards throughout the day to see your progress{" "}
  </Note>

- **Recorded or Manual Inputs**. If you connect the measured or activity cards are compatible with your connected wearables then you can set the input to record in the card preferences. This will mean that the value will be synchronised from your devices and tracked automatically.

- **Auto Complete**. Auto-completing a session will complete the card with all actual values set to the target values. This is for those sessions where you smash it and hit all your targets; hence a one-tap auto-complete will finish the card.

# Pricing

only pay for the weeks you use. the price per week depends on the block you’re running that week. Our simple pay per week model enables you to pivot and progress between blocks, or stop, finish early, or reschedule a block without any payment pain.

### build-a-block - $3.p.w

build a your perfect block from scratch using your own saved plans and sessions. Because this is completly your own block, when creating you will have increased options to select the length and your plan used throughout the block.

### bear-blocks - $5 p.w

step off on a focused training block by using a block built by us. We’ll populate your pinboard and journal with cards, and get you going with science-based realistic goals matched to your data. All of the cards in the journal and pinboard will be alligned to the goal of the block; the only thing left to do is start!

The plan and block-length are defined, however you can make your own goal adjustments and stop, start, pause or schedule the block as you need. As always, add your own cards to the pinboard or journal to add your own flavour and tailor a bear-block to your need.

### boss-blocks - from $10 p.w

step off on a focused training block by using a block built by your favourite coach. Your coach will have next level control over the cards in the pinboard and your journal. They’ll also be able to set trends, goals and challenges on all your pin-cards.

The plan and block-length are defined, however you can make your own goal adjustments and stop, start, pause or schedule the block as you need.
