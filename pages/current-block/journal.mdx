### view session targets

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    for both measured and activity cards, if a goal has been set from the
    pinboard then the target field will display the target on the right hand
    side of field. Targets are represented by either "goal", "calculated" or
    "historic" badges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### set goal targets

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    a goal target is the primary method of setting target fields for sessions. A
    goal target is the value that a session should have to follow the target
    trendline of the goal that is applied to the session pin. For example if you
    have pinned bodyweight and set a 0.25% incremental percentage goal per.week,
    then the target field will increment at 2.5% per week for the weight field
    inside the bodyweight card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    To apply a goal-target, first pin the card, and select the goal icon when
    viewing from your pinboard. You will be prompted to confirm that throughout
    the rest of the block the target fields in the session-cards will be updated
    to goal targets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Once applied, the target badge is updated to a graph symbol.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### set calculated targets

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    a calculated target uses an equation to calculate what the target field of
    an activity should be. For example 80% 1RM is an equation which multiples
    your 1 rep map by 0.8. to quickly set a a calculated target on a field tap
    the vertical ellipses on in the field options and select "set calculated
    target". This will open the set-calculated-target-modal which will allow you
    to select a calculation from the calculated-trackable-catalogue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="">
    Once selected the field will have a calculator in the target badge with
    truncated display text to indicate which calculation is applied to the
    target fields.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### complete an activity

    workout which were different to the target

</Steps>

### pin an activity card

<Steps>
  <Step title="">
    to create a pin select the pin in the footer of the card.activities can have
    several fields, however each activity pin can only have one dynamic field,
    and optionally a static field for increased specificity on your pin. When

    different fields or continue to an existing pin (if it matches) through the
    select-a-pin-modal
