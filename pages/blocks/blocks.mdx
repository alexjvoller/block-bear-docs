## Training Blocks, Not Programs

A training plan is a list of activities you do.

Training Blocks are more then training plans. They Bundle goals, progression markers, and various tools you to hit your goal over a specific time period for a specfic sport.

A training plan is isolated, a training block is **integrated**.

<Tip>
  For example an advanced powerlifting competition training block may feature
  peak-weak strength goals, incremental bodyweight goals, sleep statistics and
  claoric intake requirements to ensure the athlete is at the check-in weight. In-flight modifications such as _"if your avg. bodyweight change change is >2%, decrease cals by 300"_ which all easily supportable with block goal conditions.

Another example is Uncle John getting in his 10,000 steps a day which would feature
steps per day tracking and maybe some compliance markers. No training plan or one-on-one
coaching needed, unless you wanted too.

</Tip>

## Blocks Build and Stack.

No more discarding the training plan and your logged data once you complete it. You're logged data will be the foundational to your next one.

You don't directly climb to Everest Summit in one go. Similarly programming your training with incremental blocks is the best method for your lofty goals.
